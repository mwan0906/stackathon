# What
A website to build an A.I. to play Poker according to whatever rules you've given it, which is then pitted against other bots without intervention!

# TODO
* Make buttons to spawn divs of specific types, which can then be dragged and dropped
* Make logical statements necessary for Poker-playing intelligences
* A.I.s will keep track of:
* * what their current hand is
* * what cards have been played so far, organized by player
* * player history of folds and bets
